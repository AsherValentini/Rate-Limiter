# Original Problem Statement
You are building a component for a real-time event processing system (think: market data feed, sensor stream, network packets, etc).
The system must ensure that no more than X events per second are allowed to pass through to downstream consumers.

You are asked to build a RateLimiter module with the following behavior:

    You create it with a configurable rate limit X (events per second).

    You feed events in one by one (the system calls allow() for each event attempt).

    The RateLimiter decides whether to allow the event through based on its timing.

    If allowed, allow() returns true. If the rate limit would be exceeded, it returns false.

You can assume system time is available via your choice of clock.

Example:

Limit = 2 events/sec

t=0ms → allow() → true  
t=100ms → allow() → true  
t=200ms → allow() → false  
t=600ms → allow() → true  
t=800ms → allow() → true  
t=900ms → allow() → false  

Clarifications:

    You must design this as a reusable RateLimiter class.

    Your module must maintain internal state to enforce the rate limit.

    The external system calls allow() — your module decides.

    You can choose any modern C++ timing mechanism you like.


# Clarifying Question 
I said: Okay so in the true flavor of mimicking an interview, i will ask a clarifying question. you dont want me to create the memory structure that does the inter process handoff between prod and cons. you just want me to make the rate limiter module (seperate from say a blocking queue or ring buffer?) or do you want me to implement the queue as wellß 

# Answer 
Interviewer said:

Excellent clarifying question — this is exactly how you should behave in a real interview.

I will answer as an interviewer would:

No — for this challenge, I do not want you to implement the queue or the inter-process handoff.

Your task is to build a clean, reusable RateLimiter module only.

    Think of this module as something another component would call → "hey RateLimiter, is it okay to pass this event through?"

    The queue, consumer, etc. → out of scope.

Interface expected: something like:

RateLimiter limiter(X);  // X events/sec
bool allowed = limiter.allow();

The caller could then decide:

if (allowed) {
    // Push to queue, or send to network, etc.
}

Why this way?

In many systems (AR, HFT, trading platforms, streaming pipelines), a RateLimiter is used as a policy module, not as the queue itself.

    It tells you whether the rate budget allows the next event.

    You then decide what to do with that answer.

Building a good clean reusable RateLimiter class is the challenge here.

Summary:
No need to implement queue, inter-process comms, etc.
Just build RateLimiter module — a "policy object" that enforces rate limiting logic.

If this clarifies things — just say “Got it, Starting” — and begin 🚀.
I’ll be here to review when you post.

# Clarifying Question
further question, do i know if this module should be a singleton with an access point? whats the infrustructure context that this module will be used in?

# Answer
I will answer in the same style an interviewer would:

You don’t know the full infrastructure context.
You should design the RateLimiter as a reusable class — not a singleton by default.

Here is what you do know:

It may be used by:

    A single component

    Multiple components (each having its own limiter instance)

    One component per downstream connection / stream / topic / feed

For example:

RateLimiter marketDataLimiter(10);  // limit market data feed
RateLimiter loggingLimiter(5);      // limit log messages
RateLimiter sensorLimiter(20);      // limit sensor events

Singleton?

    You do not need to implement a singleton.

    Do not assume global access required.

    Design it so the caller can create one or more RateLimiter instances easily.

If later infra wants a global RateLimiter, they can wrap your class.

Summary:

Build a normal reusable class, not a singleton.
Provide a clean public API — e.g. RateLimiter(rateLimit), bool allow().
No assumption about shared global instance required.

Very good that you asked — shows proper engineering thinking.
You should assume this module is "library-like" — reusable, composable, no side effects.

If this answers your question — say “Got it, Starting” — and you can begin 🚀.
