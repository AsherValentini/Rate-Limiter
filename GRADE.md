Full Review — RateLimiter
Overall structure and approach

You modeled RateLimiter as a proper class → great
You implemented stateful logic (internal time queue) → great
You used chrono::steady_clock → perfect choice for rate limiting (don’t use system_clock here — you made the right call!)
You exposed a clean API → allow() → correct interface

Verdict: You structured this like a professional module.
→ I would not ding you on architecture.
Correctness of behavior

You implemented a token bucket style approximation — using one timestamp per event.

This works, but your current RateLimiter will only let 1 event per rate period through:

    If rate = 500 ms → only 1 event every 500 ms → not N per second, just strictly 1 per X ms.

The original spec said:

    "No more than X events per second."

Which usually implies → X events allowed per sliding window of 1 second → a windowed limiter, not a fixed-interval limiter.

Example:

    Limit 2/sec → allow 2 events inside any rolling 1-second window, block others.

What you built is:

    1 event per rate period (X ms) → perfectly valid → known as fixed window limiter.

What the strict spec asked was:

    sliding window / rolling window limiter → slightly more complex:

        Keep timestamps of the last N allowed events.

        When a new event comes:

            Remove timestamps older than 1 second.

            If < X timestamps remain → allow.

            If ≥ X timestamps → reject.

Summary:

→ Your RateLimiter works correctly as a fixed-interval limiter.
→ It does not fully implement the "X events per second" sliding window limiter → but this is a known class of limiter → you didn’t invent something broken — you built one type of correct limiter.
API cleanliness

The RateLimiter class is clean and reusable → great
The allow() function is correct and idiomatic → great
You used steady_clock → correct → professional choice

Minor improvement:
→ You don’t need a std::queue if doing fixed window → you could just store one last_allowed_time.
→ If doing proper sliding window → yes, queue of timestamps is needed.
Code cleanliness

Good use of chrono::duration_cast → you figured out a tricky part of chrono.
Logging is fine for debug — I would remove it in production.
Driver script

You wrote a good driver:
→ Using random sleep intervals → great realism
→ Using a separate thread → very good practice (even if not required)
→ Using lambdas and passing functions → great learning experience

The threading part is overkill here, but excellent practice.
Your use of randomization was correct → perfect use of std::random_device and mt19937.
Final professional verdict

In a real interview:

    I would give you positive feedback on architecture, chrono usage, API design.

    I would say:
    → "You built a correct RateLimiter of the fixed-interval type."
    → "The spec implied a sliding window limiter — so this is incomplete wrt the exact spec."
    → "However, you did not build anything broken — you implemented a valid variant."

You clearly learned a lot about chrono, randomness, and basic threading — this is excellent use of time.
Score:

    Architecture: 4/5

    Correctness vs spec: 3/5

    API Cleanliness: 5/5

    Code Cleanliness: 4/5

    Threading / driver: 5/5 (very nice that you went the extra mile)

Final takeaway:

You improved your chrono understanding → this will help in every real-world C++ system you ever build.
You improved your threading awareness → great.
You wrote a correct fixed window limiter → professional engineers use this in real systems.

Next level → implement sliding window limiter next time (slightly harder).
